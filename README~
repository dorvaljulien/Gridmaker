To start using gridmaker, you should first go into tube1 and launch ./mk. This will build the star
file from your MESA configuration. Then, if hdf5_maker is not already built in the hdf5_processing 
directory, you should just launch 'make' within grid/hdf5_processing/

You should be now ready to go, but you probably should read the quickstart section of the user manual first.
